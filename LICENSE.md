Box Terms of Service

Last Updated: July 1, 2014

Welcome to Box. Please read these terms of service (these "Terms") carefully as they form a contract between you and the Box entity listed in Section 17 of these Terms ("Box", "we", "us", or "our") that governs your access and use of the hosted storage solution provided by Box for online content storage, sharing and processing of files, materials, data, text, audio, video, images or other content (collectively, "Content"); (ii) the Box websites or applications; and (iii) any written or electronic use or features guides or other documentation provided or made available by Box (the "User Guides") (collectively the "Service(s)").

By registering or using any of the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Box that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, "you" and "your" will refer to that organization) unless that organization has a separate paid contract in effect with us, in which event the terms of that contract will govern your use of the Service. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and only if you have the power to form a contract with Box and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SERVICES. Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, please contact saleslegal@box.com

Please note that Box doesn't provide warranties for the Services. This contract also limits our liability to you. See Sections 14 (NO WARRANTY) and 16 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) of these Terms for details.

1. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

We reserve the right to revise these Terms from time to time. We will date and post the most current version of these Terms on the Box website. Any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version of these Terms (or such later effective date as may be indicated at the top of the revised Terms). If in our sole discretion we deem a revision to these Terms to be material, we will notify you via the Service and/or by email to the email address associated with your account. Notice of other changes may be provided via www.box.com (the “Site”) or related Box blogs. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of these Terms whenever you visit the Site to see if these Terms have been updated. Your continued access or use of any portion of the Service constitutes your acceptance of such changes. If you don't agree to any of the changes, we're not obligated to keep providing the Service, and you must cancel and stop using the Service.

If you are an individual Registered User of the Service, and the domain of the primary email address associated with your account is owned by an organization and was assigned to you as an employee, contractor or member of such organization, and that organization wishes to establishes a commercial relationship with us and add your account to such relationship, then, if you do not change the email address associated with your account, your account may become subject to the commercial relationship between Box and such organization and controlled by such organization.

7. SUSPENSION AND TERMINATION OF USE OF THE SERVICE

We reserve the right, to temporarily suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time in our sole discretion, with or without cause, with or without notice, and without incurring liability of any kind.
